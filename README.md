# Simple Calculator

This is a basic calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple interface for performing basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers.
- User-friendly interface with simple buttons for each operation.
- Works only on two numbers, and no expressions or multiple operators are supported.
- Does not follow BODMAS (Bracket, Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) rules, making it simple and easy to use.

## Limitations

- **No BODMAS support:** The calculator does not follow the order of operations (BODMAS). It calculates operations in the order they are entered.
- **Two-operand limit:** The calculator can only handle calculations involving two numbers at a time.
- **Basic error handling:**  It has limited error handling, primarily for division by zero. 

## Usage

1. **Input:** Click the calculator buttons to input numbers and operators.
2. **Calculate:** Press the "=" button or the "Enter" key to perform the calculation.
3. **Clear:** Press the "C" button or the "Backspace" or "Escape" keys to clear the display.
4. **About:** Click the "About this Calculator" link at the bottom for information about the calculator's limitations.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the calculator.
- `style.css`: Provides the CSS styling for the calculator's appearance.
- `script.js`:  Contains the JavaScript code for handling calculator logic.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Choose an arithmetic operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, or Divide).
3. Enter the second number.
4. Press the equals (`=`) button to get the result.


## Future Improvements

- Implement BODMAS support for more complex calculations.
- Allow input of more than two operands.
- Enhance the user interface with a more visually appealing design.
- Improve error handling and provide more informative error messages.
